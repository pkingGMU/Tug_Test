# Tug_Test

**Authors:** Patrick/Mackenzie/Kelly

## Description

Compare gait speed/turning velocity between single/dual task (naming animals)

**CURRENT BUILD:** Run `main.m` and choose the parent directory `TUG DATA`. Only select this one folder. Look for `fileData` as your output. `fileData` contains the filename/extension, the struct of output data (`TurnV_Trunk`/`TurnV_Lumbar`), and whether it came from Dual Task (DT) or Single Task (ST).

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `main.m` and choose the parent directory `TUG DATA`.
3. Look for `fileData` as your output.

## Notes
1. Look at `mechanical stability` - cognitive demands - associated with fall risk 

## Options to look at
1. Compare straight walking to turning steps and WHY
2. Compare peak loads from loadsole straight walking to turning steps and WHY
3. Number of animals people said between trials
4. Report tug time (stand up, walking, turning) and total time
5. Proportion of single_task/dual_task peak velocity to total tug time (Does straight time change or turning time change??) compare between conditions ('ST', 'DT')
6. Run ANOVA
