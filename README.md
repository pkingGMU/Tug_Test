Process Tug Data - (origin: google drive)

1. Used Matlab function ('readOpalData_v2.m') to pull acceleration from tug data

Compare gait speed/ turning velocity between single/dual task (animals)



Turning Velocity (Angular Velocity) 
    1. Find angular velocity at start frame of turn
    2. Find angular velocity at end frame of turn
    3.
